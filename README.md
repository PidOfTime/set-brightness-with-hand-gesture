# Gesture-Based Screen Brightness Control

This project allows you to control the screen brightness using hand gestures captured by your webcam. It uses the `cvzone` library for hand tracking, `mediapipe` for hand detection, `opencv` for video capture and image processing, and `screen-brightness-control` for adjusting the screen brightness.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- `opencv-python`
- `numpy`
- `screen-brightness-control`
- `cvzone`
- `mediapipe`

## Installation

You can install the required libraries using pip. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy screen-brightness-control cvzone mediapipe
```
## Notes
  Ensure your webcam is connected and working properly.
  Press 'q' to exit the script.
